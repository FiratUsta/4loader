4loader lets you download all media posted on a 4chan thread. The extension also lets you choose which type of media to download, as well as choose a directory within your default downloads directory to put the images in.

<h2> Usage</h2>

- Download and install the extension either manually or ~through the Firefox extensions page~ (Currently not available.)
- Click on the extension icon.
- Set your download path.
  - The default path is `4loader/`, with this the extension will create a directory called '4loader' in your default downloads directory. This value can be changed, but it is always relative to the default downloads directory and cannot be pointed out of it.
  - Make sure you append all directory names with `/`, any trailing characters without a `/` at the end will prefix the filenames of the downloaded files.
- Select the types of media to download.
  - If the checkbox next to a file format is checked, those type of files will be downloaded. Otherwise they will not.
- Click on `[ Download ]`. Your download will start.
